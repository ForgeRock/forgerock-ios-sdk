- `WebAuthnRegistrationCallback`, and `WebAuthnAuthenticationCallback` are introduced to support AM's `WebAuthn Registration Node` and `WebAuthn Authentication Node`. [SDKS-782]

#### Changed
- `FRUser.logout()` now also invalidates `id_token`, if exists, using OIDC end session endpoint after it invalidates SSO Token (using `/sessions` endpoint), and OAuth2 token(s) (using `/token/revoke` endpoint). [SDKS-328]

- Change `FRUser.getAccessToken` to clear OAuth2 tokens and handle error more percisely to reflect the user authentication status. If `refresh_token` grant returns `invalid_grant`, SDK will resume with `/authorize` flow with SSO Token (other errors with `refresh_token` grant will throw an exception), and if the `/authorize` request fails with current SSO Token, SDK will clear all credentials and states assuming that there is no more valid credentials. [SDKS-700]
- `FRUser.currentUser.getAccessToken` method will now validate SSO Token associated with `AccessToken`, and make sure that it is same as current `FRSession.currentSession.sessionToken` value. If two values are different, SDK will invalidate OAuth2 token, and try to authorize new OAuth2 token(s) with current SSO Token. [SDKS-700]
- `FRUser.currentUser.getUserInfo` no longer thorws an exception for session renewal failure; instead SDK now invokes API without `Authorization` header if token renewal failed. [SDKS-644]

- `FRAuth` was mistakenly allowing other app's private Keychain Access storage when .entitlement is misconfigured. [SDKS-552]
- `FRProximity` SDK's `LocationCollector` now requests for Location Authorization while collecting Device Profile information if the authorization has not been asked yet. [SDKS-617]

#### Deprecated

## [2.0.0]
#### Added
- `FRAuth` introduces new dependency, `FRCore` which contains generic core functionalities that can be shared across other ForgeRock iOS SDK. [SDKS-241]

- `FRAuth` is now able to handle AM's Transactional Authorization requests out of box for IG integration, and with a little bit of customization for custom REST Apps. `FRAuth` SDK can support `Authentication by Service` and `Transaction - Authenticate to Tree` in Policy environment. [SDKS-87]
- `MetadataCallback` is now supported in `FRAuth` SDK. For AM 6.5.2, when `MetadataCallback` is returned with `stage` value, SDK automatically parses `MetadataCallback` into `Node`'s `stage` property. [SDKS-304]
- `FRAuth` now allows more flexible customization on server infomration. Custom URL paths can be configured through `.plist` config file, or `ServerConfigBuilder`. [SDKS-302]

- `FRAuth` now supports customizable cookie name to align with AM. Use `.plist` config file, or `ServerConfigBuilder` to change `cookieName`. [SDKS-382]
- `FRAuthenticator` SDK is now available; use `FRAuthenticator` to implement OATH, and Push Authentication with AM in the application.


#### Changed
- `FRAuth` now supports `noSession` parameter in Authentication Tree. If no SSO Token is returned with 200 status code, `NodeCompletion` returns `nil` for all three parameters. [SDKS-433]
- `ConfirmationCallback` and `TextOutputCallback`'s invalid `MessageType` error is fixed. SDK should now be able to support those callbacks received from AM.
- Single Sign-On issue where it fails to decrypt the data from other applications is fixed. SDK should now be able to encrypt/decrypt and share the data across the apps within SSO group.


#### Deprecated
- `FRURLProtocol.validatedURLs` and `FRURLProtocol.refreshTokenPolicy` are now deprecated; use `TokenManagementPolicy` and `TokenManagementPolicyDelegate` to perform Token Management feature. [SDKS-386]
- `ServerConfig(url:realm:timeout:)` is now deprecated; use `ServerConfigBuilder` to construct `ServerConfig`. [SDKS-302]

- FRAuth iOS SDK adds security layer on Keychain Service to encrypt all stored data with `SecuredKey` (using Secure Enclave when available). [SDKS-192]

#### Changed
- `FRUser.login` now returns `AuthError.userAlreadyAuthenticated` when there is already authenticated user session. [SDKS-174]
- When Session Token is updated, or changed through `FRSession.authenticate`, or `FRUser.login`, previously granted OAuth2 token set will automatically be revoked. [SDKS-174]

#### Deprecated
- `FRAuth.next` is now deprecated; use `FRSession.authenticate` instead. [SDKS-174]
- `SessionManager` is now deprecated and will become internal class. Use `FRSession` and `FRUser` instead. [SDKS-174]

## [1.0.1]

#### Added
